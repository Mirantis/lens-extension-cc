# Mirantis Container Cloud Lens Extension

![CI](https://github.com/Mirantis/lens-extension-cc/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)

This [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) Extension adds a status bar item, and a menu item, that makes it easy to connect Lens to a Mirantis Container Cloud instance and add its clusters to Lens.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Requires Lens `>= 4.2`.

## üö® Version 2.2.0 of this extension will be the last one to support basic authentication

As of the next major release of this extension (v3.0.0), basic auth (entering the username and password in the extension itself) will no longer be supported. Your instance will need to be configured to use Container Cloud's built-in Keycloak service for authentication and authorization.

> Keycloak-based authentication/authorization is much more secure than basic username/password authentication. Consider migrating your Container Cloud instance to it if you haven't already.

As there are major changes coming in Lens 5.0 as well, when we update this extension to drop basic auth, it will coincide with the Lens 5.0 release, and any prior versions of this extension will no longer work with Lens 5.0. You will need to install an older version of Lens in order to use an older version of this extension.

## Installing

These instructions will help you install the extension for direct use with Lens. Follow the [development](#development) instructions below if you intend to work on the extension to improve it.

> NPM 6 or later is required to use the [npm pack](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-pack) command.

Until [this Lens issue](https://github.com/lensapp/lens/issues/1708) is fixed, the extension's tarball (a compressed `.tgz` file) must first be downloaded to your local system:

> ‚úã ‚ö†Ô∏è If you do not have `Node.js` (which includes `npm`) installed on your computer, [download](https://nodejs.org) and install Node.js before attempting to run the command below. Use the __LTS__ (ie. stable) version if you're wondering which version to download.

```bash
# download tar file without installing it
$ npm pack @mirantis/lens-extension-cc
```

This will download a file named like `mirantis-lens-extension-cc-X.Y.Z.tgz` to the current directory.

Start Lens and go to the Extensions View (`CMD+SHIFT+E` on macOS). Use the __file picker__ to find the tarball you just downloaded. This will install and enable the extension in Lens:

![Extension UI](./docs/ext-install-file-picker.png)

You should now be able to choose the new `File > Add Cloud Clusters` menu item, or click on the `Mirantis Container Cloud` status bar icon (far right side of the status bar at the bottom of the app), to get started.

## Upgrading

To upgrade to a newer release, go to the Extensions View (`CMD+SHIFT+E` on macOS), uninstall the extension, and then [re-install](#installing) it again.

## Development

> __Yarn 1.x is required__

First, quit Lens if it's currently running.

Then, clone the repository wherever you prefer to have your code, and then link to it:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Mirantis/lens-extension-cc.git /your/src/path
$ mkdir -p ~/.k8slens/extensions
$ ln -s /your/src/path ~/.k8slens/extensions/lens-extension-cc
$ cd /your/src/path
$ yarn       # install dependencies
$ yarn start # start dev build in watch mode
```

This will put the development build into watch mode.

Restart Lens and go to the Extensions View (`CMD+SHIFT+E` on macOS) to enable it, which will cause it to load for the first time.

Now, as you make source changes, the build will run, and all you need to do is __reload the Lens window__ (`CMD+R` on macOS) to see your changes.

You can also run a one-off development build with `yarn dev`.

> Note these steps will get much easier once [this Lens issue](https://github.com/lensapp/lens/issues/1741) is fixed.

## Uninstalling

Go to the Lens Extensions View (`CMD+SHIFT+E` on macOS) and use the UI to uninstall it.

If you followed the [development](#development) instructions, this will just remove the symlink you created in `~/.k8slens/extensions` and leave your linked directory intact.

## Publishing

First, __update the CHANGELOG__, then __use NPM__:

```bash
$ npm version <patch|minor|major>
$ npm publish --access public        # <- NOTE the '--access public' part!
$ git push && git push --tags
```

> By default, packages published to an NPM scope/org are __private__. Use the `--access public` option to publish it as a public package instead. You can also [configure NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-your-npm-client-with-your-organization-settings#setting-package-visibility-to-public-for-a-single-package) to always publish that single package publicly by running `npm config set access public` within the repository root directory (i.e. package root).

The `prepublishOnly` script will automatically produce a production build in the `./dist` directory, which will be published.

## SSO support

Mirantis Container Cloud instances that use third-party SSO authentication via __Keycloak__ are supported.

### Keycloak Configuration

Since the integration leverages the `lens://` URL protocol handling feature for extensions, __Lens 4.2__ (or later) is required, and the __Keycloak Client__ of the instance must be configured as follows:

-   Allow requests from the `"*"` origin. This is because the internal Electron browser used by the Lens App uses a random port. Therefore, the originating URL cannot be predicted.
-   Allow the following redirect URI: `lens://extensions/@mirantis/lens-extension-cc/oauth/code`

> üí° Be sure to make these configuration adjustments __on every Keycloak Client__ (`kaas` for the management cluster, and `k8s` for child clusters by default) that manages clusters you will want to add. The extension does not know ahead of time whether you have given it the appropriate access, and adding clusters without this configuration will result in an error.

### Authentication flow

The extension will automatically detect when an instance uses SSO (upon clicking the __Access__ button).

If that's the case, Lens will open the instance's SSO authorization page in the system's default browser.

Once authorized, Keycloak will redirect to the `lens://...` URL, triggering the browser to ask permission to open the Lens app to process the request (unless permission was granted previously with the _always allow_ check box for your SSO ID Provider, e.g. `accounts.google.com`):

![Lens protocol permission - always allow](docs/lens-protocol-permission.png)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Even if you check the "Always allow" box, your browser may still continue to show a popup message waiting for you to click on an "Open Lens.app" button. This is a built-in security feature. Please be on the look out for this popup in your browser whenever accessing your Container Cloud instance, or adding clusters to Lens.

Whether the permission was already given, or upon clicking __Open Lens.app__, Lens will receive focus again, and the extension will then read the list of namespaces and clusters as it normally would when using basic (username/password) authentication.

The temporary browser window used for SSO authorization will likely still be open, and should now be closed manually.

### Single cluster limitation

Due to technical issues with generating a unique kubeConfig per cluster, when the Container Cloud instance uses SSO authorization, cluster selection is __limited to a single cluster__:

![Single cluster SSO limitation](docs/sso-single-cluster-warning.png)

We hope to overcome this limitation in the future.

## FAQ

- Why are management clusters not selected by default?
    - The extension purposely doesn't not add management clusters to the default/initial set of selected clusters after retrieving clusters from a Mirantis Container Cloud instance because they are typically of less interest than workload clusters.
- I get an error, "Invalid redirect_uri", when I attempt to access or add my clusters.
    - Make sure you have properly [configured](#keycloak-configuration) all your Keycloak clients for use with the extension.
- Why can I only selected one cluster to add at a time?
    - See [Single cluster limitation](#single-cluster-limitation) when using SSO.
- I was able to add my cluster to Lens, but Lens fails to show it because of an authentication error.
    - Check if the cluster is only accessible over a private network (i.e. VPN) connection, and try opening it in Lens once connected to the network. Even though you can see the cluster in Container Cloud, as well as in the extension, accessing the cluster's details may still require a VPN connection in this case.
