<h2>Adding Clusters</h2>
<p>
  This extension makes it easy to add clusters from a ${mccFullName} instance.
</p>
<p>
  When clusters are added, <code>kubeConfig</code> files are automatically generated
  for each cluster, and stored in the configured directory. Do not remove the generated
  files (unless you remove the pertaining cluster from Lens) because Lens references
  them whenever a related cluster is activated.
</p>
<h3>Workspaces</h3>
<p>
  By default, clusters are added to new workspaces that match their ${mccShortName} namespace
  names with an added <code>${workspacePrefix}</code> prefix.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if a cluster from a <code>demo</code> namespace is added, it will
  be added to the <code>${workspacePrefix}demo</code> workspace (and the workspace will be
  created if it doesn't exist already).
</p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>
  When activating this extension via links from a ${mccFullName} instance (requires Lens
  4.1 or later), the extension UI will add an X (Close) button to the top/right corner
  of its main panel in certain cases. Click the Close button to return to the default view.
