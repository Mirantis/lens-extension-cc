# ChangeLog

## UNRELEASED

Supports Lens `>= 4.0.6`.

### Changed

- A few strings have been updated to meet branding requirements.

## 2.0.2

### Changed

- Management clusters are no longer selected by default after retrieving clusters from an Mirantis Container Cloud instance. They are typically of less interest. They can still be selected and added along with any other cluster, however.
- Some notification messages have been shortened to make them quicker to read.
- Made the cluster deserialization process more resilient (fixes [#35](https://github.com/Mirantis/lens-extension-cc/issues/35)).
- Made the namespace deserialization process more resilient (similar to [#35](https://github.com/Mirantis/lens-extension-cc/issues/35)).

## 2.0.1

### Changed

- When adding multiple clusters from multiple namespaces into new Lens Workspaces, the extension now prefers activating the first-found Workspace that is _not_ associated with the `default` namespace since it typically only contains the Mirantis Container Cloud management cluster, which is of less interest than clusters in other namespaces. If selected, the management cluster is still added, however, and can be activated in Lens like any other cluster.

## 2.0.0

Supports Lens `>= 4.0.2`.

This is a rollup of all `2.0.0-alpha.X` and `2.0.0-beta.X` changes, however, the protocol request-related features are now behind a small feature gate awaiting official [support](https://github.com/lensapp/lens/issues/1288) in Lens.

For now, the extension continues to operate as it did before, with the changes noted below.

### Added

- New Preferences Panel, which moves the preferences out of the main extension body and into the side panel.
- Current extension version is now displayed in the bottom/right corner of the Help panel.

### Changed

- When adding clusters, kubeConfig files will not be generated for clusters which are already in Lens.
- The "save location" field is now read-only. You must use the folder picker to choose an existing folder.
- A notification is now posted listing all new clusters added to Lens.
- Removed the '1-2-3' sequence on the main headings since not all steps are always visible depending on whether the extension is being used normally, or as a result of clicking on a `lens://` link.
- The status bar item is now only the icon without the label. The label is now displayed as a tooltip on hover.
- The `@k8slens/extensions` dependency has been updated to `4.0.2`.

## 2.0.0-beta.1

- Previous release was built while Webpack DevServer was running, so the output of the published files in `./dist` is questionable. This release has no changes, but it was built the right way, just to be sure.

## 2.0.0-beta.0

### Added

- Current extension version is now displayed in the bottom/right corner of the Help panel.

### Changed

- Fixed bug where 'add clusters' protocol action would show loader when actually adding clusters, rather than just when loading clusters.
- Removed test 'EVENT' status bar item.

## 2.0.0-alpha.2

### Added

- Another protocol integration: Ability to open an already added Mirantis Container Cloud cluster in Lens.

### Changed

- Removed the '1-2-3' sequence on the main headings since not all steps are always visible depending on whether the extension is being used normally, or as a result of clicking on a `lens://` link.

## 2.0.0-alpha.1

### Changed

- Fixed: Protocol request handlers are now removed when the extension is deactivated.

## 2.0.0-alpha.0

### Added

- New Preferences Panel, which moves the preferences out of the main extension body and into the side panel.
- New `lens://` protocol integrations (requires code on Lens [hackweek-protocol-handler](https://github.com/lensapp/lens/tree/hackweek-protocol-handler) branch to work with Lens):
    - Add clusters directly from Mirantis Container Cloud in the browser as kubeConfigs.
    - Add selected clusters from Mirantis Container Cloud in the browser. This requires providing your password prior to adding the clusters you select (because each cluster gets its own kubeConfig file, and each one needs its own cluster access-specific token), but no longer requires you to copy/paste the Mirantis Container Cloud instance URL into the extension and signing in that way.

### Changed

- When adding clusters, kubeConfig files will not be generated for clusters which are already in Lens.
- The "save location" field is now read-only. You must use the folder picker to choose an existing folder.
- A notification is now posted listing all new clusters added to Lens.

## 1.0.5

Update for Lens `4.0.0` official release.

## 1.0.4

### Changed

- Adjusted the padding on the status bar item so it isn't so squished in the right corner or against other status bar extension items.
- Adjusted the color of the status bar item to always be white regardless of the theme (which fixes an issue where it was a dark color when switching to the LIGHT theme).
- Now relying on Lens to provide styling for custom scrollbars (see [lens#1484](https://github.com/lensapp/lens/pull/1484)).

## 1.0.3

Update for Lens `4.0.0-rc.1`.

### Changed

- Removed deprecated (and now removed) global page `addRoute` property.

## 1.0.2

This release contains no code changes.

### Added

- Missing standard package.json metadata
- Screen shot to README

## 1.0.1

This release contains no code changes.

### Added

- NPM-based installation instructions to the README

## 1.0.0

### Added
